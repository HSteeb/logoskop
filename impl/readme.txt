Source code for Logoskop, viewer for The Word of bible2.net
=================================================================

For MS Visual C++ 6.0 (based on MFC)
Entry point: w32los/w32los.dsw
License: see LICENSE.txt
User manual: contained in installer on bible2.net.

Note: the source code still uses out-dated filenames, variables etc. of my former
"w32los" application (of losung.de), like "Losung", "LosFile", "Old Testament"
etc. This is just to save the effort for global renaming - there is no
functionality left to support data of the Moravian Watchwords ("Herrnhuter
Losungen", of losungen.de). In particular, the supported file format is *.twd
(not de_los??.xml), and online access contacts bible2.net, not losung.de.
