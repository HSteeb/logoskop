<h1><a id="Logoskop" name="Logoskop">What is Logoskop?</a></h1>

<p><strong>Logoskop</strong> (greek <strong>word viewer</strong>)
displays <strong>The Word</strong> - two related bible quotations for each
day of the year, published by Project Bible 2.0 <a
href="http://bible2.net/">http://bible2.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Author: Helmut Steeb <a href='http://www.jsteeb.de/'>http://www.jsteeb.de/</a>.
I am grateful to my Lord Jesus Christ who makes me able to provide Logoskop.</p>

<hr />

<h1><a id="features" name="features">Simple usage</a></h1>

<p>After installation, </p>
<ul>
<li>Logoskop automatically displays The Word for the current day</li>
<li>... for your language (guessing from your operating system settings), or English,</li>
<li>... from the respective The Word files contained in the installation package</li>
<li>... until the year is over - then you need files for the next year
(you may use menu File | Actualize The Word).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1><a id="morefeatures" name="morefeatures">Features</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>copy The Word to the <strong>Windows clipboard</strong> (menu Edit | Copy).</li>

<li>put the application into the <strong>startup folder</strong> (during the installation)</li>

<li>select <strong>multiple bible editions in different languages</strong>
using the comboboxes in the toolbar or menu File | Organize The Word.
</li>

<li>install <strong>additional The Word texts</strong> (*.twd) for other languages
or for years to come (menu File | Organize The Word)</li>
<li>change the <strong>language of the user interface</strong> 
(i.e. menus and message texts...)
in menu Edit | Options. The new language is used after a restart of Logoskop.</li>

<li>Logoskop can display information about
the <strong>bible texts used</strong> using menu View | Copyright.
To display The Word again, again toggle 
menu View | Copyright or select another day or language.</li>

<li>suggest additional related bible quotations over the Internet
(menu Edit | "Suggest related bible quotations").</li>

<li>configure Logoskop to create <a href="#emailsig">email signatures</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h1><a id="install" name="install">Installation</a></h1>

<ul>

<li>System requirements: Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7
(also under Linux, tested with Wine 1.0.1).</li>
<li>Run the installer. Finally, Logoskop will start automatically.</li>

<li>If during installation you experience <strong>problems with write
permissions in the folder e.g. "C:\Program files"</strong>, try to
install Logoskop into a different folder, e.g. "D:\Logoskop".</li>

<li>The installer contains the text files for the year to come. After installation in the previous year, Logoskop tells you
that - for the rest of the year - the texts for the year to come will be
displayed. You may conveniently download the texts for the current year
(using menu File | "Actualize The Word")</li>

<li>If The Word is not displayed correctly, try menu Edit | Layout and select a different font.</li>

</ul>

<h1><a id="emailsig" name="emailsig">Create an email signature that contains The Word</a></h1>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>In popular email programs you may define a "signature". Any time
you create a new email, your email program adds the signature
automatically at the end of the new text, before you edit the
text. Typically, the signature contains your name and your email
address, like</p>

<pre>
--
John Doe
john@doe.org
</pre>

<p>If your email program stores the signature in a text file on
your hard disk, you may configure Logoskop to write The Word
into this file (at the time Logoskop starts). Any
time you create a new email, then, the email will already contain
The Word as a signature.</p>

<p>Logoskop writes The Word as simple text with line breaks,
without special colour or font information. If you use to write your
emails in HTML format, the signature written by Logoskop will probably
not look as you expect.</p>

<h2>Configuring the email signature - which text file?</h2>

<p>The most important question for using this Logoskop feature is:
<strong>which is the signature file that your email program reads for
new emails?</strong></p>

<p>To answer this question, you may proceed as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>copy some text from the signature of a new email to the Windows
clipboard. The text should be unique, you may just try your email
address.</li>

<li>on your hard disk, search for a file that contains this text. You
may use: Start menu - Search - "Files/Folders", with the search options:

<table>
<tr><th>Dialog item</th><th>Typical search option</th></tr>
<tr><th>Search in:</th><td>C:\</td></tr>
<tr><th>Name:</th><td>*.txt</td></tr>
<tr><th>Include subfolders</th><td><em>check this!</em></td></tr>
<tr><th>Text contained:</th><td><em>your text</em></td></tr>
</table></li>

<li>if you find a file, please check whether it actually contains the signature</li>
<li>enter the complete path to this file into the Logoskop configuration dialog</li>
<li>in Logoskop, press "Write signature now"</li>
<li>create a new email in your email program - if the signature is there, you're done!</li>
</ul>

<p>Different email programs store their signature at different
locations on your hard disk. Here is an incomplete list of email
programs and the folders where you may find the signature file:</p>

<table class='table'>
<tr><th>Program</th><th>Menu item / location of signature file</th></tr>

<tr><th>GeMail (Freeware)</th><td>C:\Program Files\GeSoft\GeMail\Mails\Signatur.da1</td></tr>

<tr><th>Mozilla 1.4</th><td>Menu Edit | Mail &amp; Newsgroup Account Settings |
path in "Append this signature"</td></tr>

<tr><th>MS Outlook Express</th><td>Menu Extras | Options | Signatures | Edit Signatures</td></tr>

<tr><th>MS Outlook 2000</th><td>Menu Extras | Options | E-Mail format | Signature<br />
stored in e.g. C:\WINNT\Profiles\JohnDoe\AppData\Microsoft\Signatures\JohnDoe.txt
(see location of <a href='#APPDATA'>AppData</a>).</td></tr>

<tr><th>MS Outlook 2002 (SP2)</th><td>Menu Extras | E-Mail format | Signatures | New | Use this file as template</td></tr>

</table>

<h2>Configuring the email signature - the Template</h2>

<p>The signature that Logoskop writes should contain not only The Word but
also your name and email address, of course.  You define the contents of the
signature in a "template". This template may contain any text. At the places
where you want to appear the complete The Word text or parts of it, you
enter some special placeholders. Logoskop will replace these placeholders by
the text of the respective day.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
--
John Doe
john@doe.org
--
%TL;

%PAROL1;

%PAROL2;
--
</pre>

<p>will be expanded e.g. at 2008-11-01 to</p>

<pre>

John Doe

The Word for Saturday, November 1, 2008

The shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God
for all they had heard and seen,
as it had been told them.
Luke 2:20 (ESV)

Bless the Lord, all his works,
in all places of his dominion.
Bless the Lord, O my soul!
Psalm 103:22 (ESV)
--
</pre>

<p>Logoskop detects the placeholders:</p>

<table class='table'>
<tr><th>Placeholder</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><th>%THEWORD;</th><td>the complete text of The Word including date line</td></tr>
<tr><th>%TL;</th><td>the date line</td></tr>
<tr><th>%PAROL1;</th><td>the first bible verses</td></tr>
<tr><th>%PAROL2;</th><td>the second bible verses</td></tr>

</table>

<h2>HTML Email</h2>

<p>Here is an example (donated by Axel Schlüter 2005-11-28 for w32los) to produce
a signature usable in an HTML formatted email with the Thunderbird mail program:</p>

<pre>
&lt;font face="Tahoma"&gt;
&lt;div style="position:relative; left:30px; color:white; margin:30px 30px 30px 0px;
      background-color:#000040; width:280px; padding:30px 20px 20px 30px;"&gt;
%TL;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
%PAROL1;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
%PAROL2;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Logoskop writes the placeholders only as text, not as HTML (see also in "SignatureLineSeparator" in the chapter <a href="#inifile">INI File</a>)</li>
<li>Logoskop writes the signature file at every start</li>
<li>Logoskop uses The Word in the first language that is displayed at program start</li>
<li>Logoskop supports two encodings for the signature: the encoding that is used in your operating system, and UTF-8 (toggled by the "file is in UTF-8" checkbox in the "Configure email signature" dialog)</li>
<li>if Logoskop writes the text in the encoding that is used in your operating
system, and you write The Word in a language with characters not supported by
that encoding, the characters will typically be replaced by a "?" (just check
this using the button "Write to file now" in the configuration dialog).  On
a Western operating system, e.g.  Chinese text will produce Lots Of Question
Marks.</li>
<li>"file is in UTF-8" may produce the right result for your email application,
but for UTF-8, the preview at the bottom of the Logoskop dialog will only
display Ascii characters (A-Z...) correctly.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1><a id="advfeatures" name="advfeatures">Technical details</a></h1>

<h2><a id="location" name="location">Location of The Word files</a></h2>

<p>Logoskop organizes the texts for The Word (.twd files) in a <a name='APPDATA'
id='APPDATA'>special Windows folder where applications may store their
data</a>, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\YOURNAME\Application Data\bible2.net\</li>
<li>Windows Vista: C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\bible2.net\</li>
<li>Windows NT: C:\Windows\Profiles\YOURNAME\Application data\bible2.net\</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="filenaming" name="filenaming">File naming, language and date selection</a></h2>

<p>Logoskop displays files in .twd XML format that conform to 
   a document type definition called thewordfile (which you may download from bible2.net, but
   you do not need it to display the text).</p>
<p>Logoskop assumes the standard file naming convention e.g. "de_Schlachter2000_2009.twd", i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>the "language code" (may but need not be the same as in the xml:lang attribute within the file) </li>
<li>the name of the bible used</li>
<li>the four digit year number</li>
<li>the extension "twd" (the word)</li>
</ul>
<p>When it displays the current day, Logoskop recognizes any changes of 
    the date and re-displays the text for the now current date
    (on dec 31, it might even switch to another file using the naming convention).</p>
<p>When you switch to another year, Logoskop re-reads the contents
of the application directory to see which languages are available.
If there is no language available
in the new year, an error message will be displayed.
</p>

<h2><a id="startOnce" name="startOnce">Start only once per day</a></h2>

<p>In the options dialog you may choose to start Logoskop <strong>via
startup folder</strong> only once per day. If this is enabled, Logoskop
simply exits before the application window appears in case you start it
more than once. Note that this setting as well as the fact when Logoskop
has been started the last time is stored in the INI file - if you use
different INI files, the "start only once" applies to each INI file
separately. The option is not checked if you start Logoskop directly
from the applications menu or in Windows Explorer.</p>

<h2><a id="copying" name="copying">Copying to the clipboard</a></h2>

<p>Logoskop copies the text into the clipboard using two different "clipboard formats": the
regular "Text" format and the "Unicode" format.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Unicode" format: this clipboard format can hold texts in (almost) any language.</li>
<li>"Text" format: this clipboard format can hold only text of one special "codepage",
e.g. the West European, or the Russian codepage. Your system uses a "default codepage"
(depending e.g. on your version of Windows).
Logoskop can <em>display</em> text without regard to the default codepage, but the 
"Text" format of the clipboard can only hold text in the default codepage.<br />
If Logoskop displays a "foreign" language (e.g. Russian on a West
European Windows), the "Text" format of the clipboard 
cannot hold these data, it either mis-interpretes
them as characters of its current codepage, or replaces them by an "unknown 
character indicator" (typically a question mark).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some applications automatically fetch text from the clipboard in "Unicode" format
(e.g. current Word versions), these will work appropriately.</p>

<p>On Windows 9.x, applications typically use the "Text" format only, 
you may not be able to paste foreign language text into such an application.
</p>

<p>Arabic text will be copied in "logical order" (i.e. in the order of writing
from left to right) without shaping and ligatures.</p>

<!--TBD
<p>In case the text contains emphasized or added portions
(internally coded with XML tags EM), these will be copied 
using textual separators like "" or {{ }}.</p>
-->
<h2><a id="download" name="download">Download</a></h2>

<p>In Logoskop, you may download The Word texts using</p>
<ul>
<li>the dialog <strong>Actualize The Word</strong> 
(allows download of text for currently displayed bible editions
and for the current year or the year to come), and</li>
<li>the dialog <strong>Organize The Word</strong> (allows download of several texts at once, for any year
for which project Bible 2.0 has got texts).</li>
</ul>

<p>To download texts, you need a working connection to the Internet. If you're in a company,
you probably cannot access the Internet directly but only via a <strong>proxy</strong> or 
<strong>firewall</strong>. There are three ways for Logoskop to handle a proxy:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the proxy settings from Internet Explorer. You can modify these e.g. 
in the Windows control panel (Internet options).</li>
<li>do not use any proxy. This is ok e.g. if you're running Logoskop at home with a modem.</li>
<li>set proxy address manually. 
The address might look like "www-proxy".
You may also specify the port for accessing the proxy, like "www-proxy:8080"
(i.e. address and port are separated by ":"; port 80 is the default).
Ask your network administrator if you don't know the address, 
or have a look e.g. in Firefox settings 
(Firefox 3: Tool-Preferences-Extended-Network, or the like)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your proxy needs a username and password to connect to the Internet, Logoskop will query these
as soon as you try to download data. For security reasons, Logoskop does <em>not</em> remember
your username or password.</p>

<p>For downloading files, Logoskop communicates with a HTTP service running at
bible2.net. Logoskop does not transmit information to the service besides data
needed for HTTP communication.</p>

<p>If you have problems establishing a connection, and Logoskop stops trying too soon, you may
increase its timeout value (see "Timeout" in the <a href="#inifile">Ini file</a> chapter).</p>

<p>Note: some Internet providers redirect the first URL you enter (the first HTTP request)
to their own site, for each of your Internet connections.
Logoskop uses HTTP to download the The Word. 
Therefore, if the first action in your Internet connection
is to download The Word using Logoskop, then the first HTTP request 
of Logoskop gets redirected, too, and receives an HTML page 
instead of a The Word file!
If you experience mysterious failure when you try to
download The Word, you may try to visit any web page in your browser first. Then - in the
same Internet connection - try downloading a The Word file in Logoskop.</p>

<h2><a id="datectrl" name="datectrl">Date and time picker control behaviour</a></h2>

<p>Logoskop uses a Date and time picker control to
change the date the watchword is displayed for. 
Some Windows 95 versions may not have this
Date and time picker control, in this case
the respective area of the toolbar remains empty
(technically speaking: you need version 4.70 and later of Comctl32.dll,
which comes with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x or greater).
</p>

<p>The Date and time picker control accepts input as follows:</p>

<!-- source: MSDN | Plattform-SDK | User Interface Services | Shell and Common Controls | Common Controls | Common Controls -->

<table class='table'>
<tr><th>Input category</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Arrow Keys</td>
  <td>The user can press the LEFT ARROW or RIGHT ARROW keys to move through the control. <br />
The UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys change values in the current field incrementally.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>End and Home</td>
  <td>change the value within the current field to its upper and lower limits, respectively.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Function Keys</td>
  <td>The F2 key activates edit mode. <br />
The F4 key causes the control to display a drop-down month calendar control
(pressing ALT+DOWN ARROW does this as well).
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Numbers</td>
  <td>The control accepts numeric input in two-character segments. 
  </td>

<tr>
  <td>Plus and Minus</td>
  <td>increment and decrement the value in the current field
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a id="cmdline" name="cmdline">Command line arguments</a></h2>

<p>Usage: </p>
<pre>
  Logoskop [-i INIFILE][-autostart]
</pre>
<p>Logoskop accepts as optional argument the path of the ini file. 
You might start Logoskop several times, each time specifying a different ini file.
Then you can place these Logoskop instances at different places on your desktop, select
different languages and colours within them etc.</p>

<p>For the parameter "-autostart", see <a href='#startOnce'>Start only once per day</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="inifile" name="inifile">INI file</a></h2>

<p>Logoskop stores settings in the file Logoskop.ini in the directory
AppData\bible2.net (the <a href='#APPDATA'>location of the folder
"ApplicationData" depends on your version of Windows)</a>.</p>

<p>Special settings (not controlled by any dialog):</p>
<dl>

<dt>[General]<br/>Timeout=15000</dt><dd>this is the timeout used for Internet connections, in 1/1000 seconds.
  It defaults to 15000 (i.e. 15 seconds).</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>SignatureTemplate=<em>PathToFile</em></dt><dd>denotes a file in that Logoskop
stores the template text which you define in the dialog "Configure email signature"</dd>
<dt>[General]<br/>SignatureLineSeparator=&lt;br/&gt;</dt><dd>defines e.g. the HTML command
"&lt;br/&gt;" to be used as line separator, instead of a simple line break.
The strings "\t", "\r" und "\n" (two characters, respectively: a backslash
followed by a letter) will be replaced by the respective control character.</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>LogfileLevel=3</dt><dd>activates the logging of application actions into a logfile
(default: 0 = not activated). Valid values are:
0 = no logging,
1 = log only error messages, 
2 = ... plus info messages
3 (and all other values) = ... plus internal status messages.
In the Options dialog, you select between on (=3) and off (= 0).</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>Logfile=c:\temp\Logoskop</dt><dd>sets the name of the logfile
(default: "Logoskop.log" in the directory of Logoskop.exe)</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>ParseStrict=1</dt><dd>lets Logoskop reject any The Word file
that contains unexpected XML elements (default: 0)</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>UseUSP10=0</dt><dd>
  Set UseUSP10=0 to disable use of the Microsoft Uniscribe Processor (USP10.DLL) for displaying texts.
  An internal processor (based on the open source FriBidi algorithm) will be used instead.
  You may modify this setting via the Options dialog. 
If Logoskop fails to load or use the USP10.DLL (e.g. when run under Linux using Wine), 
it will automatically turn UseUSP10 off.</dd>

<dt>[General]<br/>SetMonthCalFont=0</dt><dd> if you have
  problems with the font in the calendar control, you may try adding
  this setting. Its effect is that the font of the calendar is not
  initially set to the font of the toolbar (default: 1).</dd>
